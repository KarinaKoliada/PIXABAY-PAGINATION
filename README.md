# Image Search Application

This project is a frontend application for searching and viewing images by keyword using the [Pixabay API](https://pixabay.com/api/docs/). Key features include:

- **Search Form**: Users can search for images using a keyword.
- **Image Gallery**: Displays search results with details like likes, views, comments, and downloads.
- **Pagination**: Loads images in batches of 40 with a "Load More" button for seamless browsing.
- **Notifications**: Uses [Notiflix](https://github.com/notiflix/Notiflix#readme) for user-friendly messages.
- **Lightbox Integration**: Supports full-size image previews with [SimpleLightbox](https://simplelightbox.com/).
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Enhances user experience with animated scrolling for new image batches.

The app is built with `async/await` for handling API requests and styled with responsive UI elements.
